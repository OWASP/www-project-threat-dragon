## What is Threat Dragon?

OWASP Threat Dragon is a tool used to create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their
mitigations.

TD is both an online threat modelling web application and a desktop application. It includes system diagramming as well
as a rule engine to auto-generate threats and their mitigations. The focus of TD is on great UX, a powerful rule engine
and alignment with other development lifecycle tools.
