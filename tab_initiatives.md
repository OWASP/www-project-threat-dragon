## Initiatives

We appreciate greatly all our contributors: without their open-source contributions Threat Dragon would be long-gone.

There are some individuals and teams that have come forward to make an 'above and beyond' difference to Threat Dragon,
and here they are:

### Integration with EoP Games

A team from the Universidad Católica del Uruguay ([UCU](https://www.ucu.edu.uy/)) took part in a Coding Challenge
to provide integration between Cornucopia and Threat Dragon.
In addition they made it extensible so that other EoP-type cards can be integrated into Threat Dragon.

We are very grateful and look forward to more contributions to the open-source community:

* Anthony Pereira ([Clarensedor](https://github.com/Clarensedor))
* Belén Bulla ([bbulla](https://github.com/bbulla))
* Belén de Oliveira Madeira Ferreyra ([beldomadeira](https://github.com/beldomadeira))
* Chris Bentancor ([ChrisBentancor](https://github.com/ChrisBentancor))
* Diego Gamarra ([gamarradiego](https://github.com/gamarradiego))
* Emanuel Fraga ([FragaEmanuel](https://github.com/FragaEmanuel))
* Gaspar Lamas ([gasparlamas](https://github.com/gasparlamas))
* Guillermo Guerrico ([GuilleGuerrico098](https://github.com/GuilleGuerrico098))
* Javier Moreno ([javiermorenov1203](https://github.com/javiermorenov1203))

and many thanks to Gerardo Canedo ([gerardocanedoUCU](https://github.com/gerardocanedoUCU)) for making this happen.

### Google Summer of Code 2024

Mohamed El-Bohy ([mohamedselbohy](https://github.com/mohamedselbohy)) devoted his summer of 2024
to completing the Threat Dragon functionality.
When Threat Dragon moved from version 1.x to version 2.x it was not feature complete,
and Mohamed implemented these final features for Threat Dragon.

### Migration to Vue and antv/x6

Leo Reading ([lreading](https://github.com/lreading)) travelled the long road of migrating Threat Dragon
from AngularJS + JointJS to Vue + antv/x6.
This ensured that Threat Dragon made it to version 2.x,
otherwise Threat Dragon would be swamped with unsupported dependencies.
