## Description
Threat modelling is widely regarded as a powerful way to build security into the design of applications early in the development lifecycle. At its best, it is especially good for
* Ensuring defence-in-depth
* Establishing consistent security design patterns across an application
* Flushing out security requirements and user stories

However, effective adoption by organisations can be difficult. Reasons for this include:
* There are no cross-platform, free tools (that I am aware of)
* The usability of existing tools is not great - productivity for the team is therefore poor, especially in the early stages of adoption
* The learning curve for teams is steep - threat modelling often ends up being left to a small "expert" subset of a team and ignores the valuable perspectives from the wider team
* Integration with other development lifecycle tools (e.g. issue tracking tools) is poor - leading to models being ignored

OWASP Threat Dragon addresses this by providing a free, open-source, threat modelling web application for teams implementing the STRIDE approach. The key areas of focus for the tool is:
* Great UX - using Threat Dragon should be simple, engaging and fun
* A powerful threat/mitigation rule engine - this lowers the barrier to entry for teams and allow non-specialists to contribute
* Integration points with other development lifecycle tools - when implemented this will ensure that models slot easily into the development lifecycle and remain relevant as the project evolves
