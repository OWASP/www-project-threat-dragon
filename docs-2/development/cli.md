## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

With the desktop version of [Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) installed,
and if the executable is in the environment path, then Threat Dragon can be run from the command line.

For example after install on MacOS and Linux:

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon`

or after install on Windows:

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon.exe`

AppImage does not need installation, so after downloading version 1.3.1 (for example) just run:

`./OWASP-Threat-Dragon-1.3.1.AppImage`

There is also a command line interface which can be used (again if the executable is in the environment path)
to directly access some of Threat Dragon's functionality.
For example run this command to get help :

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon --help`

Or to export a given threat model file to pdf :

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon --pdf ./threat-model.json --verbose`

If on Windows:

`OWASP-Threat-Dragon.exe --pdf .\threat-model.json --verbose`

or using AppImage (using version 1.3.1 for example):

`./OWASP-Threat-Dragon-1.3.1.AppImage --pdf ./threat-model.json --verbose`

*Note* that the path to the JSON file needs to be resolvable, so use the full path
or the './' if the file is in the working directory.

Here is the help contents for version 1.3.1 :

```text
