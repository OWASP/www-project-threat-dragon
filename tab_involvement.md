### Getting Involved
#### Testers
Great user experience is one of the key goals for the project and to get that right it needs more users!
If you would like to try the tool out, that would be great. The working prototype can be found at:

https://threatdragon.org/

The desktop installers for Linux, Windows and OSX, as well as .rpm / .deb packages for Linux, can be downloaded from:

https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-desktop/releases

To help you get started, take a look at the documewntation:

https://threatdragon.github.io

If you are still having problems, let us know and we will be pleased to help (mike.goodwin@owasp.org and jon.gadsden@owasp.org).
All feedback is very welcome, so either email us or put an issue on GitHub

#### Coding
Coding help of any kind is always welcome. The project builds easily (let us know if you have any problems)
so getting up and running should be simple.

#### Threat rule engine
If you are not into javascript, you can still help! We need to build a powerful threat generation rule engine
to replace the one that is in place for the prototype / early releases. If you can contribute in this area by
defining rules, that would be great.
