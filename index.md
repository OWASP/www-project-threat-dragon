## What is Threat Dragon?

OWASP Threat Dragon is a modeling tool used to create threat model diagrams as part of a secure development lifecycle.
Threat Dragon follows the values and principles of the [threat modeling manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/).
It can be used to record possible threats and decide on their mitigations, as well as giving a visual indication
of the threat model components and threat surfaces. Threat Dragon runs either as a web application or as a desktop application.

Threat Dragon supports STRIDE / [LINDDUN](https://www.linddun.org/) / CIA,
provides modeling diagrams and implements a rule engine to auto-generate threats and their mitigations.

### Resources
Use the [documentation](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/docs-1/) to get started, along with the recording of Mike Goodwin
giving a [lightning demo](https://youtu.be/n6JGcZGFq5o) during the OWASP Open Security Summit in June 2020.

An [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUOAoc6QGJo) to Threat Dragon is provided by
the [OWASP Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUKo5k_oSrfOTl27gUmk2o-NBKvkTGw0T) series,
and the [Threat Modeling Gamification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2tmLrwv-nc) seminar by Vlad Styran
shows how using Threat Dragon can make threat modeling fun.

There are a couple of OWASP community pages that give overviews on Threat Modeling and how to get started:
[Threat Modeling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling)
and [Threat Modeling Process](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process).

The easiest way to get in contact with the Threat Dragon community is via the OWASP Slack
[#project-threat-dragon](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/CURE8PQ68) project channel.
