### Getting Involved
#### Alpha testers
Great user experience is one of the key goals for the project and to get that right it needs some users!
If you would like to try the tool out, that would be great. A working prototype can be found at:

https://threatdragon.org/

The desktop variant (for Windows and OSX) can be downloaded from:

https://github.com/mike-goodwin/owasp-threat-dragon-desktop/releases

To help you get started, take a look at the (draft) docs:

http://docs.threatdragon.org/

If you are still having problems, let me know and I will be pleased to help (mike.goodwin@owasp.org).
All feedback is very welcome. Either email me or put an issue on GitHub

#### Coding
Coding help of any kind is always welcome. The project builds easily (let me know if you have any problems)
so getting up and running should be simple.

#### Threat rule engine
If you are not into javascript, you can still help! We need to build a powerful threat generation rule engine
to replace the stubbed one that is in place for the prototype. If you can contribute in this area by defining rule,
that would be great.
